/* function divide(weight){ 
  return (weight % 2 == 0) && weight > 2;


  return weight remainder value zero. is it actually an if/else?
  ***and if weight is greater than 2
}


const divide = weight => weight % 2 === 0 && weight !== 2;

^ function that says if remainder of weight % 2 === 0 and checks that weight
is not the same type as 2

function divide(weight){
  //your code here
  return (weight >= 4 && weight % 2 === 0)
}
^ has to be greater than 2(in this ex's case, 4)
